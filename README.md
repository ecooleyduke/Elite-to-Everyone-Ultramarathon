# üèÉüèîÔ∏è From Elite to Everyone: The Evolving Face of Ultramarathon Running

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 7.4 million ultramarathon race records from over 1.6 million unique athletes using the dataset [The big dataset of ultra-marathon running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running) publicly available on Kaggle. Using this data, we explore how the sport of ultrarunning has evolved in terms of performance, participation, and diversity.

The goal is not only to chart finish times, but to ask:  
**"Is the sport better now that it‚Äôs slower but more inclusive, or worse because the focus on elite performance is diminished?"**


## What‚Äôs in This Project

- **Performance Trends Over Time**  
  Average finish times by distance and year uncovering the long-term slowdown in the sport.

- **Finish Time Distributions**  
  Box plots showing how the performance spectrum has widened, especially in events like the 50K.

- **Engineered Feature: Athlete Age**  
  Calculated from birth year and event year to explore aging trends in participation.

- **Diversity Metrics**  
  Country and age diversity plotted over time to visualize inclusion across demographics.

- **Ethical Reflection**  
  Discussion on whether the rise in slower finish times reflects a positive shift toward inclusivity or a decline in competitive standards.

## Key Takeaway

Ultramarathon running isn‚Äôt just for elites anymore. The sport is slowing down and become more accessible to everyday runners.
